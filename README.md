# Gauss
Humanity took to space in a desperate attempt to find a new home,  only to find that aliens have long before called the black abyss their  domain and don't take kindly to outsiders.

Years later humans ride the line of extinction moving about in the  galaxy as intergalactic nomads...unable to settle for too long before  the Hunters, as humans have deemed them, discover their location...  

The only reason humanity isn't completely annihilated is due to their  protectors, a courageous and fearsome group of pilots known as the  Gaussian Fleet.

These brave pilots fight to delay humanity's extinction as scientists search desperately to find a way to transport the remaining human race far enough away that they can begin rebuilding civilization in peace... But with each passing day the Hunters grow more aggressive and the light at the end of the tunnel grows dimmer...

We must find the answer...
